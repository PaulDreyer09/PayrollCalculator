# Tax Calculator Application

This repository contains a tax calculator application that utilizes various design patterns such as the command pattern, visitor pattern, dynamic property assignment, and the abstract factory pattern. The application is designed to calculate taxes for different countries, and it includes a Node prompt version for interactive use.

## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to clone and run the application on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed on your machine.

```

Install the required dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

### Running the Application

To run the application, use the following command:
this.name
```bash
npm run nodeEntry
```

This will execute the Node prompt version of the tax calculator.

### Running Tests
